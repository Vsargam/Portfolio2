			<p> In Dublin High school I have attended school in 2019 in my first year in 9th grade. My courses are Algebra 1, English
        1, Biology, Spanish 2, Computer Science Principles, Health, and P.E. Some of the colleges I am interested in are Stanford,

			<p>Cashier- Taking the order from the customer and handling the payments. I was employed on October 22. Drink Maker-
        I was responsible for make the drinks for the customers.</p>
			<h4>Extracurricular activities (Hobbies/Interests)</h4>
			<p>I have a very big passion for playing cricket I am in a club in school which won a cup just 2 weeks ago. Also, I am in a club outside of school which is called SRCA. I was the captain of the school cricket club when I was captain I brought home the 3rd place cup for our team. I am also in a lot of other clubs including the magic club to help my friend with his urge to create that club. I also used to be in the chess club I was really good but I left because I just couldn't handle all of the other clubs I was doing outside of school which put a big toll on me. I am also in the club DECA which is a business club where you get a scenario to sell this sort of item and brand it right then and there. There are Minicons where you can participate in challenges and compete against other people. These help in real-life scenarios. But there are also tests that we do and they show us how good we are doing in DECA. </p>
        <h4> Languages </h4>
        <p> I am fluent in a lot of languages because I was born outside of America and was attached to the Indian lifestyle where I was born. The languages that I am fluent in are Hindhi, (Speaking, Reading and Writing) Marathi, (Speaking, Reading and Writing) Telugu, (Speaking, Reading, Writing) English. But I am learning a language too which is Spanish. I am learning this language at school and I am in Spanish 2.</p>
