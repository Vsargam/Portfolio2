						<h4 class="card-title">Scratch Project</h4>
						<p>This is my Scratch project one of the first projects I have ever done. The course I did this project for was Computer
							Science Principles. The date this project or game was released was September 5th, 2019. That is when we showed everyone
							in class this project. the objective of this project/game was to platform over obstacles and reach the end of the
							game as fast as you could. The best so far of the game was recorded each time you got a better score. My role for
							this project was the documentation but I also did a little bit less than half of the coding. I was documentation so
							I had to be precise with my observations I also was the big helping hand on the idea creation of the project. I learned
							a lot when I was creating this game. But my main areas of learning improvement was the coding aspect my partner was
							very fluent with coding I had learned a lot from coding with him and around him.</p>
