  <h6> <h5>Hello, My name is Vishal Sargam,</h5> <p>and I am a student at Dublin high. I love my school not only because I get to program also because I get to do more interesting and helpful stuff other than studying. I am 14 years old right now and am in 9th grade. even though I have just started high school I have a lot of accomplishments.</p>
    
    <p> As some of the projects, I have worked on. You can see these and mess around with these projects in the project section of my portfolio. As I am working I am finishing another project which is my Online Portfolio. One of the first-ever projects I worked on was the Scratch project which I worked on with a partner Mikhail. On this project, we had to design a game out of the programming language scratch. We had created a game where you needed to reach the end the fastest. We also created a timer at the end. Here it takes the best so far and records it. I had also made a 2nd game about harry potter this as well I worked on with a partner. I and my partner were discussing ideas for a long time but finally concluded. We had chosen a project theme we both had liked which was Harry potter.</p>
    
    <p> Those were some of the projects that I did in my call of Computer science principles. In the future, I am most likely going to look forward to the business industry. This is because I am very interested in business because I have a lot of ideas and thoughts that I would like to discover and stock. </p>
     
      <p>Currently, in Computer Sci Principles we are working on HTML and bootstrap. As we learn about HTML and Bootstrap we are doing or creating projects to help us understand HTML and Bootstrap. Some of my goals are to get into the DECA program which is a business club about presentations and conveying a product to viewers that know nothing about it.</p> 
      
      <p>You can contact me at vsargam7@gmail.com. Some of the skills that I am developing are mostly CSP and sports I am playing cricket that is my biggest passion I have joined the club and also I am in a cricket club outside of school which is SRCA. This is all about me I hope you have a better understanding of who I am and what I am like.</p> </h6>
